            "id":1,
            "que":"How does solar energy work?",
            "ans":"Solar energy works by capturing sunlight through solar panels, which convert it into electricity using photovoltaic cells. This electricity can then be used to power homes or businesses."
        },
        {
            "id":2,
            "que":"What are the benefits of switching to solar power?",
            "ans":"Switching to solar power offers several benefits, including reduced energy bills, decreased reliance on fossil fuels, lower carbon footprint, potential financial incentives, increased property value, and energy independence."
        },
        {
            "id":3,
            "que":"How much can I save on my energy bills by going solar?",
            "ans":"The amount of savings varies depending on factors like your location, system size, energy consumption, and available incentives. On average, solar panel owners can save 20% to 100% on their electricity bills"
        },
        {
            "id":4,
            "que":"What incentives and rebates are available for installing solar panels?",
            "ans":"Incentives and rebates differ by location, but common ones include federal investment tax credits (ITC), state and local incentives, solar renewable energy certificates (SRECs), and net metering programs."
        },
        {
            "id":5,
            "que":"How long does a solar panel system typically last?",
            "ans":"Solar panel systems have a lifespan of 25 to 30 years or more. Most reputable manufacturers provide warranties for their panels, ensuring performance for a specified period."
        },
        {
            "id":6,
            "que":"What is net metering and how does it work?",
            "ans":"Net metering is a billing arrangement where excess solar energy generated by your system is sent back to the grid, and you receive credits for it. These credits can offset the energy you draw from the grid when your panels aren't producing enough."
        },
        {
            "id":7,
            "que":"Will solar panels work during cloudy or rainy days?",
            "ans":"Solar panels can still generate electricity on cloudy or rainy days, although at a reduced efficiency compared to sunny days. They can still produce a significant amount of power even under less ideal weather conditions."
        },
        {
            "id":8,
            "que":"Is my home or business suitable for solar panel installation?",
            "ans":"Most homes and businesses are suitable for solar panel installation as long as they have access to sunlight. Factors like roof orientation, shading, and available space will be assessed during a site evaluation to determine the viability of installation."
